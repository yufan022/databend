# if cached filters are populated incorrectly by using the wrong cache key:
# - instead of the correct one ${block_id}-${column_id}
# - but ${block_id} incorrectly
# the cached filter that populated by the previous query
# `select * from bloom_test_t where c1 = 5`
# i.e. the bloom filter of block 1, column c1, will be used in bloom pruning of
# ALL the columns of block number 1

# recall that
# a) the data of first block is
#  `create table bloom_test_t(c1 int, c2 int)`
#  `insert into  bloom_test_t values(1,1), (5,6), (10,10)`
# b) range index is not effective in the later test cases
# c) if filter cache is populated incorrectly (as described in PR #9706)
#    bloom filter of block 1, column c1 will be used for all the columns (of block 1)
# let's check it out

# 1. filter using another column (c2), of the same block, where there is one row matched

# 1.1 check that filtering on column c2 does work as expected
